# MovieBox 
Moviebox is inspired simply by refactoring one of my earlier projects I've done in the past. This has simply more features, stronger and more coherent UI/UX design and objectively an overall better website.

This uses ReactJS and I used purely my own custom CSS instead of Ant.Design compared to my old project which gives its more of it's own personality.

## Technologies 
-SASS

-Simple React Lightbox

-TheMovieDatabase API

## Older Project 
This was the older project that I've used the same API. It has similiarity but it's much less refined.
